    "text": "Welcome to my first blog post! If you don’t already know, this blog is tracking the progress of my 3-month Senior Project. I am currently learning the basics of building an R package. My hope by the end of my project is to build a helpful, original package full of functions I use regularly.\nIn the past few weeks, I have spent most of my time watching tutorials on YouTube to learn the basic structure of a package environment. Here is one video I found particularly helpful. I thought he did a good job of explaining the different default documents that come with building a package project in Rstudio.\nThis is what I was looking at with the most basic package stucture. This is all default, just the bare bones of package creation.\n\nAfter playing around with building some unique user-defined functions, I realized I have a lot to learn haha. My next steps are to learn more about UDFs (User Defined Functions) in R and how to make a good one. I also want to fulfill my goal of submitting a package to CRAN before the semester ends. After looking around, I know this will also take some time. I think this page will come in handy.\nAnother update coming soon!"
